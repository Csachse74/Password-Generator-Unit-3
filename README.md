# Password-Generator-Unit-3
During this activity i felt as though i was either doing too much code or not enough.
It was a fun activity though. I have three separate versions with in the code. V1 and V2 are both commented out and give a discription of why and a little bit of my thought process.
I also added what line each refactor is now on to show what it used to be and give a referance to what it is now.
i feel like i could not have done anything else to improve the code or to make it more efficent.
